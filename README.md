Project Title:
Children’s Book Trends & Market Insights — A Pathway to Inclusive Publishing
This project analyzes a dataset of 1,200 children's books to uncover key trends in pricing, ratings, age targeting, and bestseller categories. 
The goal is to draw insights that can guide the development of culturally inclusive educational materials such as Amharic books for the Ethiopian community aborad.

•	Using Python and Tableau, we explore which age groups are most targeted, 
•	what types of books are bestsellers,
•	how pricing correlates with customer satisfaction, and 
•	What opportunities exist for underrepresented voices in the children's book market?
